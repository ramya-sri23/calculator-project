            <strong>Machine Learning Intern</strong><br>
            Internship on <strong>Credit Score Classification using Machine Learning</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            During this internship, I worked on analyzing financial datasets,
            preprocessing data, building machine learning models, and evaluating
            performance to predict creditworthiness.
        </p>

        <p>
            This experience helped me strengthen my understanding of
            <strong>Python, Data Analysis, Machine Learning algorithms, and real-world problem solving</strong>.

        <h3>Weather Forecast App</h3>
        <p>
            The Weather Forecast App is a responsive web application designed to provide real-time and accurate weather information for any location. The app fetches live data using the OpenWeather API and presents it in a clean, user-friendly interface.

Users can search for any city to view current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and weather status. The application also displays sunrise and sunset timings, air quality index (AQI), and a 5-day weather forecast, helping users plan their activities effectively.

The app is built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript, ensuring fast performance and cross-device compatibility. It uses API integration, asynchronous JavaScript (fetch API), and dynamic DOM manipulation to update weather data in real time.

This project demonstrates practical skills in frontend development, API handling, data visualization, and responsive design, making it suitable for real-world use.

        <h3>Credit Score Classification</h3>
        <p>
             Credit Score Classification is a machine learning–based project that predicts an individual’s creditworthiness by analyzing financial and behavioral data. The main objective of this system is to classify customers into categories such as Good, Standard, or Poor credit score, helping financial institutions make informed lending decisions.

The model uses historical data including income, loan amount, payment history, number of credit cards, outstanding debt, and credit utilization. After data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling), various machine learning algorithms are trained and evaluated to achieve accurate classification results.

        <h3>Amazon clone</h3>
        <p>The Amazon Clone is a front-end web development project that replicates the core user interface and layout of the Amazon e-commerce website. The main objective of this project is to understand real-world website structure, responsive design, and user-friendly UI development using modern web technologies.

The application includes key features such as a navigation bar, search bar, product listings, categories, shopping sections, and a footer similar to the original Amazon website. The project focuses on creating a visually appealing and responsive design that works smoothly across different screen sizes.

This project helped in gaining hands-on experience with HTML page structuring, CSS styling, Flexbox/Grid layout, and basic JavaScript interactions. It strengthened understanding of front-end development concepts and improved the ability to build scalable and professional-looking web interfaces.</p>
